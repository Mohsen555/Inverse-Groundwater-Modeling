First, I would like to thank my major advisor Prof. Amvrossios Bagtzoglou of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at University of Connecticut. The door to Prof. Bagtzoglou office was always open whenever I ran into a trouble spot or had a question about my research or writing. His guidance helped me in all the time of research and writing of this thesis. He consistently allowed this thesis to be my own work, but steered me in the right direction whenever he thought I needed it.
Besides my major advisor, I would like to thank the rest of my thesis committee: Dr. Zoi Dokou and Dr. Jeffrey Starn, for their insightful comments and encouragement. Without their passionate participation and input, this accomplishment would not have been possible. Dr. Dokou also provided me an opportunity to join the PIRE project team which encouraged me to learn more about groundwater modeling and widen my knowledge from various perspectives. My sincere gratitude goes to Dr. Jeffrey Starn of USGS for the continuous support of my related research, for his patience, motivation, and immense knowledge.
I would also like to thank my fellow lab-mates for their stimulating discussions, supporting my work with careful comments and encouraging me and giving me their priceless advice on how to deal with obstacles both in research and my student life.
Last but not the least, I take this opportunity to extent my gratitude to all of the Department faculty and staff members for their help and support. I also thank my parents for the unceasing encouragement, support and attention. Thank you all.
